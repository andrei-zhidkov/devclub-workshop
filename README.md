## Project structure basics
### `package.json`
`package.json` lists all third-party dependencies that are installed in the project, along with the versions that should be used.

### `webpack.config.js`
This file specifies the configuration that will be used by Webpack to bundle the code.

### `.babelrc`
Here resides the Babel config, that determines how the source code should be transformed to the actual code that'll run in the browser.

### `index.html`
Template that HTMLWebpackPlugin will use to generate actual index.html file

### `index.js`
Application entry point.

### `app.js`
Root React component.

## Bonus task
Modify the `<App />` component so that it has two additional elements â€” `<p></p>` and `<input type="text" />`.
Make the `<p></p>` element reflect the value of `<input type="text" />`.
